        The Blogging Itch

<div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Starting a blog has been in my personal todo list for years. Finally, after encouraging myself with <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/03/users-dont-care-about-you.html">some</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step.html">old</a> <a title="post" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/02/fear-of-writing.html" target="_self">posts</a> from Jeff Atwood (yeah, I like reading <a title="Jeff Atwood" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" target="_self">Jeff Atwood</a> and I frequently agree with him), I decided to just kicked it off with whatever I have in my mind: why it has been so difficult to get started? Why now? It was not only procrastination, there has been something else. Let me explain.</p>

<p>I started using routinely a feed reader around 4 years ago. Since then I&rsquo;ve been constantly replacing the blog feeds I follow with others I found more interesting. Right now all the blogs I&rsquo;m following are excellently written, and I&rsquo;m not talking only about celebrity blogs, but also the kind of highly technical blogs that make it, for example, into <a href="http://planet.python.org/">Python planet</a>. When I think about the quality of writing I would like for my blog several blogs from Python planet come to my mind. But even if I put myself a much lower quality threshold to get started, it turns out that writing something of acceptable quality, just the writing, is indeed harder than it seems. I can <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2009/04/seven-productivity-tips-for-people-that-hate-gtd/" target="_self">allow myself to suck</a> but can&rsquo;t go public with something I know is total crap. Recently I reached a writing level where I&rsquo;m comfortable enough to go public.</p>

<p>But obviously publishing a decent blog is not only about writing properly. You need something to write about. For me it&rsquo;s not worth writing superficially just for the sake of writing. In order to comment on something I need to have a deep understanding of the matter, otherwise I can&rsquo;t confidently give a public opinion. But for that to happen I need something I didn&rsquo;t get until recently: specialized knowledge.</p>

<p>When I started my Biochemistry degree back in Spain I liked computers as a hobby  (I was a relatively early Linux user) but my real passion was molecular biology, the wet lab. Soon I realized how much tedious manual work and luck influenced in successful biological experiments. In the other hand, <em>experiments</em> using the computer were quick and you could somehow understand much better what was going on.</p>

<p>Later I worked for <a href="http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu/akhilesh.html">Akhilesh Pandey</a> developing <a href="http://hprd.org/">HPRD</a>, a human protein database that included (and still does) plenty of high quality manually curated from scientific literature not found in any other biological databases. My role was a kind of bridge between the programmers, the curators and the biological requirements for the project. My research career started totally different to what it&rsquo;s expected from a young researcher, instead of specializing in something first and from there try to understand later how what you study contributes to science in general, I had to first understand the global picture before trying to get into the nitty-gritty. That didn&rsquo;t mean I didn&rsquo;t want to get deep into different areas. The problem was that I wanted to get into too many things at the same time. After some time the fields where I really ended up focusing have become fewer. Now, instead of working in large teams, I work more isolated in a very specialized projects within the area of proteomics informatics.</p>

<p>Then if finally I ended up working in a very specialized topic was the global view experience a waste of time? Absolutely not. My way of thinking has been critically shaped since then. I&rsquo;m the kind of person who has to have a clear reason of everything I do. Now it&rsquo;s clear for me on what I want to focus on, without losing the context of everything I do. I know what I want to learn and for what. I still maintain more or less the same goals that I had when I got into research, the difference now is how I want to reach those goals. But I&rsquo;ll leave my goals for another post.</p>

<p>In the end the lack of specialized knowledge has been a important blocker to start a blog. I didn&rsquo;t feel with enough authority to write acceptable posts for concrete topics. Now in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics">proteomics</a> I&rsquo;m more or less getting above the knowledge threshold where I can start writing something critically.</p>

<p>At the same type proteomics informatics is a blend of very different specialized topics. In proteomics I still don&rsquo;t totally understand how a <a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/masspec/howitworks.html">mass spectrometer</a> works but of so much parsing, merging, querying, filtering, and plotting mass spec data I got a good handle of what mass spec proteomics data is like. About programming I&rsquo;m far from writing something I would qualify as <em>good code</em>. Even if my coding capabilities have improved over the years I qualify my code worse than I used to. In reality my code is better now, it&rsquo;s just that, with time, I&rsquo;m becoming more critical about what I would call good code. However I&rsquo;m fully aware that being so critical with my own code is a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/07/nobody-hates-software-more-than-software-developers.html">symptom of programming competence</a>. I feel I&rsquo;m on the right track, if I keep pushing like I&rsquo;m doing I&rsquo;ll eventually get to write something I could qualify as good enough. For now I feel competent enough in Python to start saying something meaningful about programming publicly.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that now I have some specific knowledge and a decent ability for writing. One would think that these factors provide the ideal scenario to start a blog. I know that having a blog is very important for my profession but that hasn&rsquo;t be the last push to start now. I&rsquo;m writing this post right now because I need it. Let me rephrase it: I&rsquo;m not forcing myself to write a blot, I need to write.</p>

<p>What is really happening is that blogging is just part of a bigger transformation I&rsquo;m going through. I&rsquo;ve been lurking for quite some time different open source communities, initially just to learn more from people who are way better than me in programming. But lately I have been developing a great admiration for certain communities and  individuals. I need to give them something back. I&rsquo;m gradually participating more in the community. Now I need show who I am, how I see the world, what I want in life and what do I admire and why.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m blogging.</p>
