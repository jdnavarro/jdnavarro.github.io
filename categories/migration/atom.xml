    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally found some time to migrate my blog to <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Octopress</a> from
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Wordpress.com</a>. The critical reason to migrate from Wordpress has
been the support for nice code syntax highlighting, something I
couldn&rsquo;t have wordpress.com, at least for free. I know there are very
nice wordpress plugins for syntax highlighting but in order to use
them I would have to host it myself. I don&rsquo;t want to go through the
hassle of maintaining a typical PHP/MySQL stack or to be worried about
being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotted"><em>slashdotted</em></a>.</p>

<p>Having worked with an excellent documentation tool like <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>, I
started looking to static blog generators meant. It turned out that
<a href="http://blog.manuelviera.es/">Manu Viera</a>, a colleague working at <a href="http://www.yaco.es/">Yaco</a> with me, shared the
same itch and had already looked several static web generators in
Python, which is our main language at <a href="http://www.yaco.es/">Yaco</a>. Manu found
<a href="https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican">pelican</a> the best candidate but still I found it a bit immature,
not something like something like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Octopress</a>, a framework built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>
with <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/">several plugins</a>, including syntax highlighting or automatic
support for <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a> comments.</p>

<p>The migration from wordpress was not too painful. I used the default
Jekyll script to import wordpress posts and disqus importer for the
comments.  After some sed commands I got nice markdown formatted
scripts.</p>

<p>I had some trouble in the beginning configuring an isolated Ruby
runtime in <a href="http://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> just for Octopress but after discovering
<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>, everything went smooth. (I prefer rbenv instead RVM with
rbenv I know at any moment what it&rsquo;s doing).</p>

<p>Deploying an Octopress generated site to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> is as
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/index.html">easy</a> as pie.</p>

<p>Aside of nice Python syntax highlighting now I have some extra
advantages I didn&rsquo;t have with wordpress.com:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Markdown syntax when writing my posts.</p></li>
<li><p>I can use the best text editor to mankind: <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> :P</p></li>
<li><p>My blog data becomes more manageable. If at some point I don&rsquo;t want
to host it github, I could just to push it somewhere else with no
modification.</p></li>
<li><p>I got a very nice default theme for free, that aside of looking
good, it&rsquo;s also very easy to tweak and maintain.</p></li>
<li><p>Now I have a good excuse to learn Ruby outside of RoR influence.
Ruby is one of those languages I wish I would be better at, even if
Python remains my main working language.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In any case, I must say the service provided by wordpress.com has been
quite good but this one of those cases where you have to say: <em>“Sorry,
it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s just me”.</em></p>
