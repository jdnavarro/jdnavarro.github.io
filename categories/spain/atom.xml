    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After almost 3 years in The Netherlands working as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics">proteomics</a> informatician at <a href="http://bioms.chem.uu.nl/">Albert Heck&rsquo;s lab</a>, I&rsquo;m moving to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla">Seville</a>, Spain, to work as a web developer for<a href="http://yaco.es/"> Yaco Sistemas</a>, a fresh and dynamic open source friendly company.</p>

<p>This is an important shift in my career since I won&rsquo;t be working on proteomics informatics and academic research anymore. I have mixed feelings about leaving proteomics. On one hand I like the area because there are plenty of tough challenges to be solved. But on the other hand I&rsquo;m glad I can dedicate all my time to develop web applications, that might not be as sophisticated as proteomics software, but that will be immediately useful for the <em>masses</em>. I love web development and the Python community but within proteomics I could only intersect with the Python web development community quite sporadically. Now I&rsquo;ll have the chance to be part of it full time.</p>

<p>Personally, The Netherlands is the most comfortable and easy-going country I ever lived. Here I had the chance to work with very smart people and made friends that will never forget. What I have learned during these years is priceless.</p>

<p>But I can&rsquo;t deny my origins, Spain is where I feel at home even if sometimes I don&rsquo;t find it too exciting because I&rsquo;m too familiar with the culture. However Seville is quite far from <a title="Pamplona" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamplona">my hometown</a>, in the North of Spain. The culture in the South is very different from the North, so in a way, I&rsquo;ll be another foreigner excited about the peculiarities I discover about Andalusian culture.</p>
