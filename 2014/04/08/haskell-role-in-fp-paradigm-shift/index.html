    <p>I was listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Tate">Bruce Tate</a> in <a href="http://mostlyerlang.com/">Mostly Erlang</a> podcast, when, around
the 57th minute of <a href="http://mostlyerlang.com/2014/03/04/031-bruce-tate/">the episode</a>, the topic of the conversation
became the feasibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">FP</a> becoming mainstream. He explains that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">FP</a>
has not emerged yet, but it’s reluctantly about to do so, being the end of
Moore’s law the main driver as concurrent/parallel programming becomes
more critical.</p>

<p>I agree with him about this trend, although I also think it’s easy to
overestimate the time it will take. I think it’s going to be very slow.</p>

<p>Another interesting idea, he mentions is that within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">FP</a> field, a clear
<em>winner</em> may arise, as it happened with the C/C++, and all its descendants. The
four candidates he postulates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>/<a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>He dismisses <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> for not being approachable enough, similarly to when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> came out.</p>

<p>I also think there’ll be a <em>winner</em>, understanding for <em>winner</em>, the
language most programmers and companies will use (i.e. Java would be a
<em>winner</em> now). But I don’t see being a  <em>winner</em> language, in this sense,
so relevant. To me, what’s really important is to see how prominent is
going to be the software written in that language, and how much of current
business will be run in code written in such language. A language could be
considered not mainstream by programmers and companies, but there may be
several critical widespread software that wouldn’t be possible without it.
For example, I see this trend going on with <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> being used in
critical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">IM</a> services, distributed databases, message queuing systems,
etc. Current shops with expertise in <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, even if not mainstream,
have a clear competitive advantage when writing scalable systems.</p>

<p>In this sense, I think <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> may never be a <em>winner</em>, but the question
is still open about how crucial will it be in the future. What will be the
business perspectives for the few companies proficient in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>? Who
cares if there are few proficient <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programmers as long as there
is a pool of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programmers to hire (which currently it seems there
is) and taking into account the strong hint that if someone is proficient
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> she has already very high chances of being a very productive
programmer?</p>

<p>I guess this <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">same argument</a> was the same used with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>, but now
there are some differences. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> idioms are, inherently, very
heterogeneous, whereas <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, in spite of not having the equivalent of
being <a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html">Pythonic</a>, is much more understandable among programmers working in
different projects. Secondly, there are certain
parallelization/concurrency problems that are very hard to get them right
with traditional languages, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">STM</a>. I’m not an expert in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> but I guess it lacked the killer feature that make using it a need,
more than just a nice advantage.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my opinion is that <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> has a very good chance of
becoming very relevant even if it doesn’t become the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">FP</a> language
<em>winner</em>. I see its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional">purity</a> and side-effect management as enablers of
killer features in the area of concurrent/parallel programming. Somehow,
the vibrancy of the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> community these days, reminds me of the
[Python] community before Google made it popular. Will all
this be enough to make <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> relevant? I guess time will tell.</p>
