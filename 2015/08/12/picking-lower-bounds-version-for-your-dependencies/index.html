  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I always get an uneasy feeling when explaining this topic to new
programmers. I limit myself to something along these lines: “In this case
I’m choosing these versions because of <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>, were the
circumstances different I would probably have chosen differently”. In
these sessions I try to stick to the act of coding so I try to not digress
too much into such hairy matters as version management. Nevertheless, I
think a decent criterion for picking these versions is something important
for a developer expected to work independently.</p>

<p>I don’t think a precise guide could be written on the topic. The ability
comes naturally with experience and some common sense. In this post I’ll try
try to bring forward some factors to weight in when choosing the minimal
dependency versions.</p>

<p>For concrete examples I’m focusing on the Haskell ecosystem, where I’m
spending most of my time these days, but I guess it could be directly
translated to other ecosystems.</p>

<p>I’m assuming the word <em>package</em> is a unit of code shipped with a version
number. In Haskell this is a <a href="https://www.haskell.org/cabal/">Cabal package</a>, but it could be a
<a href="http://pythonwheels.com/">Python wheel</a>, a <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/">Ruby gem</a>, or a <a href="https://crates.io/">Rust crate</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>

<p>There are 2 non-mutually exclusive broad categories here, although the
distinction can get quite blurry.</p>

<h3 id="push-based">Push-based</h3>

<p>In this kind of deployment you are directly <em>pushing</em> your code into an
environment where it’ll be built<sup id="fnref:e"><a href="#fn:e" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and executed. Here you have precise
knowledge of the environment where your code will run.</p>

<p>This is the typical setting for web server applications. In this case, version
bounds are not so important, it’s alright to just set the minimum versions
to the ones you are using for development. However in this scenario it’s
almost always a good idea to pin all the dependency when building. You
want deterministic repeatable builds and avoid nasty surprises, specially
when dependencies get updated. For most packaging systems there is always
some mechanism for freezing versions outside the package specification.  In
Haskell you can manually<sup id="fnref:f"><a href="#fn:f" class="footnote">2</a></sup> pin dependency versions in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cabal.config</code> or you
can use <a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> and <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack">stack</a> to manage version dependency sets smoothly.</p>

<p>At the package level you want to maintain maximum flexibility so that you can
test different dependency versions easily, specially to get early warnings when
dependencies are updated. You could think of the versions limits in the core
package specification as the versions that will never be picked, no matter the
circumstance.</p>

<h3 id="pull-based">Pull-based</h3>

<p>In this case you are packing your code and uploading it to some kind of
central package repository. Consumers will <em>pull</em> the package and install
it on their system. Your code will run on systems that are outside of your
control.</p>

<p>A frequent use case is to support as many target users as possible.
Often enough, the users will run your code on very heterogeneous
environments and you don’t want them to step into any problems when trying
your new shiny package.</p>

<p>By default it’s wise to aim for low dependency versions, but you don’t need
to go as far low as possible. It’s usually a good idea to target the
lowest versions that are still getting maintenance upgrades (more about
this later). For example, in the case of Haskell, unless you have a
specific reason, I think it’s reasonable to tell your users that you are
not supporting GHC-7.4.3 (Haskell compiler) anymore. You can select
the version cut-off based on the fact that the oldest GHC version of the
major Linux distributions, is <a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/ghc">GHC-7.6.3</a>, in Debian Jessie<sup id="fnref:a"><a href="#fn:a" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. But your
mileage may vary, it all depends on the users you are targeting. The more
data you have about them, the better you’d be able to make these kind of
decisions.</p>

<p>In my experience, for pull-based packages, it’s best to build and test
your code with both the maximum and minimum versions at the same time. If
running both tests takes too long, you can move one test suite, the
minimum one usually, to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI</a> system. In any case, it only makes sense to test
both the latest and the oldest sets of dependencies, don’t bother trying
different set combinations unless you have a very specific reason, I’ll explain
why below.
<!---
In the case of GHC, I often use Debian as the central authority I trust to
set the minimum lower bounds. But your choice of maintenance authority can
be very different. Ideally, having real data of the environment your users
users have will help you make better decisions. You'd also have to take
into account factors like whether you want to force users to upgrade? Did you
give them enough deprecation warnings with enough time to not piss them
off? But handling API upgrades is outside the scope of this post.
--></p>

<h2 id="release-channels">Release Channels</h2>

<p>For new libraries there is just a single channel following the latest
version, but for more mature ones you can usually identify at least an
extra channel with more conservative releases. Notice here that even if
the original authors don’t explicitly maintain multiple channels, you can
still find downstream packagers that do keep releasing
security/performance fixes while maintaining a frozen API. And even
without 3rd party packagers it’s possible to distinguish virtual
channels with some implicit knowledge gained by social means. For example,
do you know which version is mostly used by the community? or what early
adopters are reporting when trying newer versions? It’s good to follow bug
reports, mailing lists or relevant forums to get a sense of the stability of
the packages.</p>

<p>How aggressively new features get released on each channel vary greatly
between authors and communities. Some communities are notoriously
disciplined about maintaining strict release policies but you should
always keep an eye for authors breaking ranks. In general, you can always
assume that with new features inevitably come new bugs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the build with the minimum version dependencies represents the most
stable <em>edition</em> of your code (instead of just providing extended backwards
compatibility), so it’s a good rule of thumb to keep it in sync with a
conservative but still active channel that you trust. If you find a <em>killer</em>
feature that you absolutely need in production, you should be aware of the
responsibilities coming with living in the bleeding-edge. For example, is the
upstream author responsive to bug reports? Do I have the capability to fix bugs
if push comes to shove?  Notice that, although ugly and cumbersome, there are
mechanisms to get conditional compilation based on the dependency version being
present while building. In Haskell this is done with <a href="http://projects.haskell.org/cpphs">CPP macros</a>.</p>

<p>While thinking about this, it’s also a good moment to consider any security
implications. Can you afford the risks of the bleeding-edge? Perhaps your
application is a prototype, but are you sure it’ll remain one? What would need
to be done if it goes into production?</p>

<h2 id="known-working-sets">Known Working Sets</h2>

<p>Identifying individual channels for each package doesn’t guarantee they
will work together. What you need is a <em>distribution</em> of packages with
versions that are frequently tested together for compatibility. These
<em>distributions</em> usually have their own release channels as well.</p>

<p>Theoretically, you could pick and choose different channels for each
package, and although this approach may work for projects with few
dependencies, in practice this quickly spirals out of control as the
number dependencies grows. If you avoid running into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>, the
combination of versions can make your build so unique that any potential bugs
you find may be irrelevant or hard to reproduce for the rest of the community.
By sticking to a trusted <em>distribution</em> you take advantage of more people
looking for bugs in the same build you are working or if you discover the bugs
yourself you’ll get better support if your working set of dependencies is a
common one. This could be considered a weaker version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's_Law">Linus’s
Law</a>.</p>

<p>When choosing a <em>distribution</em> it’s often helpful to distinguish 2 rough
categories: language runtime specific but system agnostic, and system specific
but language runtime agnostic<sup id="fnref:b"><a href="#fn:b" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For example, in Haskell, <a href="http://www.stackage.org/lts">Stackage LTS</a>, or even the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>,
can be considered examples of the first kind. No matter what OS or
hardware architecture you are on (provided GHC supports it), if you pick
the minimum versions from any of those sets, you can be pretty
confident that there won’t be compatibility issues. This type of
distributions work very well when your whole codebase is written for the
same language runtime. However, when the number of dependencies not
included in the distribution grows (for example, dependencies coming from
a different language runtime), your chances of running into problems grows,
too.</p>

<p>The other kind of <em>distributions</em> are the ones providing full system
integration for a given hardware architecture, with kernel and userspace
applications being released together. Here I have in mind the typical
Linux distributions and the BSDs<sup id="fnref:c"><a href="#fn:c" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>System distributions provide the strongest guarantees that all moving
parts work together, specially if you get your package included in the
distribution. But doing so can be quite hard, you’ll have to make sure your
packages adheres to all the distributions policies, which usually are
quite strict.</p>

<p>That’s why integrating your code into an system distribution can sometimes
add non-trivial overhead. Also, focusing on just one OS distribution can
reduce drastically the users you can target. This is not an issue for push
based deployments though.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t use system distributions directly, you can still extract
a good known working set from the versions they selected.  You have to
keep an eye on any patches the packagers may have introduced that are not
included upstream. If those changes are not distribution specific, they
are usually propagated upstream, but sometimes for whatever reason,
upstream authors don’t accept them.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>For the lower bounds of pull-based Haskell packages, I usually follow the
Debian stable channel which usually has oldest set of versions still being
maintained.</p>

<p>For push based deployments, a very popular system distribution within the
Haskell community is <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>. Aside of the many advantages the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix</a>
package manager over conventional managers, from a curation perspective,
the <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> community is extremely responsive and provides a very smooth
barrier of entry for new Haskell packages<sup id="fnref:d"><a href="#fn:d" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the latest upstream versions of every
dependencies can be considered a virtual quasi-distribution. Although this
target obviously moves very fast, it might not be as chaotic as you might
expect. Most upstream developers give priority to the latest version, so
they usually make sure their software works well with the latest versions
of other dependencies. This is not a bad choice for experimental and
prototype projects, and even if you are relying exclusively on pinned
versions, it’s always useful to test against the latest dependencies as a
way of getting a heads up on what needs to be done to keep your code
up-to-date.</p>

<p>I deliberately omitted writing about new projects like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> or <a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/">Snappy
Ubuntu</a> that claim to solve many all our deployment issues with container
superpowers. I do believe container based deployments, both for server and
for end users, are the right trend but I’m still, as of today, not sold on
using Docker for production. But that’s a story for another day.</p>

<p>I also don’t want to get into the topic of upper version bounds because
it’s a whole different debate, and there are many valid arguments pro and
against. I personally lean towards not putting any restrictions because it
makes upgrading new packages an easy process, even at the cost of having
some users getting broken builds when new dependencies come out. This
shouldn’t be a problem for production systems because I’m assuming prudent
users should be using pinned versions and building their packages before
deployment. However if for some reason, your package is broken and you
know you can’t fix it soon enough, I’d say it’s OK to make a quick release
with upper version bounds if you already know it will break. I know there
are many counterarguments to my position, like for example, when you want
to make sure a package released today will be buildable in 20 years at
that particular version. I’d mark that old version as deprecated and
forget about it, but that’s sacrilege for some. In the end this is all
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a> to me, so even if I’d rather have no upper limits, I don’t
think it’s a big deal having to handle them.</p>
